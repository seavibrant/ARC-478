                <strong>RATIONALE:</strong>
                <p>What effect does ambient noise and music have on subjects wearing <span
                        style="color: #5fa052;">SCP-714</span>?</p>

                <strong>HYPOTHESIS:</strong>
                <p>Since <span
                    style="color: #5fa052;">SCP-714</span> has several mental effects on subjects wearing it, in particular slowed reactions and
                    reduced mental capacity, the subject may be unable to describe certain aspects of the noise/music
                    they are hearing.</p>

                <strong>PROCEDURE:</strong>
                <p>Once I had taken the needed audio tapes from the archive, I begun by requesting a Class-D and
                    combative to
                    transfer C over the radio, both of which were
                    quickly on the spot. The CD was given the agreement paper and I asked for the <span
                        style="color: #8f2d2b;">combatant's</span> ID. I then
                    gave the CD a light briefing on what the test would inflict upon him, in this case no harm since
                    <span style="color: #5fa052;">SCP-714</span> does not have any harmful effects on the wearer. Once
                    finished we moved into Sector-2B and
                    headed towards the item storage. On the way, <span style="color: #78B9F3;">Adept Researcher
                        MCJu3464</span> joined us and oversaught the
                    test, he had said that he would on the radio but I had missed it. Once at the item storage, someone
                    opened the storage container for <span style="color: #5fa052;">SCP-714</span> and the CD took it, he
                    was then asked to give it to the
                    combative, he complied with this order. <br><br>The group then headed for the MPCC where the CD was
                    further
                    briefed on the contents of the test. He was told to wait with putting on the ring until I gave him
                    the order, and to listen to the music and ambience provided by me. The CD was then told to enter the
                    inner chamber and wait for my next instructions. But before that, MCJu asked everyone for their IDs,
                    I was unaware that this had to be done in the chamber but I am now a bit wiser regarding that.
                    <br><br>Once
                    the CD had entered the chamber, he was told to listen to the "City Ambience" tape once before
                    putting on the ring. Upon being asked if he could hear the tape, he answered "No" but a short moment
                    later changed his answer to "Yes", mentioning that his volume was low. The <span
                        style="color: #8f2d2b;">combatant</span> then asked me
                    if he should send the ring down, to which I answered yes. The CD recieved the ring and was told to
                    put it on, after confirming that he was wearing it, he was asked if he could hear any differences in
                    the audio. To this he answered with <i style="color: orange;">"sounds a bit more upbeat"</i>. After
                    this regard, I changed
                    the tape to the one labeled "Goofy Song". The CD was then asked what he could tell regarding this
                    audio, to which he answered with <i style="color: orange;">"no changes, sounds goofy."</i>. The CD
                    was then told to remove
                    the ring, and to listen to the music again, this proved to have no effect as he said that taking the
                    ring off provided no change in the audio. Lastly, the CD was told to put the ring back on and listen
                    to the "Night Ambience" tape. He was then asked what he could tell about this audio, to which he
                    answered with <i style="color: orange;">"makes me picture a forest, placid music, very
                        calming."</i>. Once I had removed
                    the last audio tape, the CD was told to remove the ring, send it up the chute,
                    and exit the chamber. The CD was asked if he had any final remarks about the test, to which he said
                    no. Right as the test was concluded, a riot was initiated and the CD was swiftly terminated by the
                    <span style="color: #8f2d2b;">combatant</span>, who then returned <span
                        style="color: #5fa052;">SCP-714</span> to the item storage.
                </p>
                </p>

                <strong>CONCLUSION:</strong>
                <p>The experiment showed minimal changes in auditory perception due to wearing <span
                    style="color: #5fa052;">SCP-714</span>. The test
                    subject's ability to describe the auditory stimuli remained intact and consistent, with minor differences in the
                    interpretation of sound reported while wearing the ring. The key observations I made during this
                    test were, but not limited to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Subject's ability to hear and describe ambient noise and music was not significantly affected
                        by
                        SCP-714.</li>
                    <li>Subject's perception of sound quality and mood was unaltered while wearing <span
                        style="color: #5fa052;">SCP-714</span>, with
                        minor
                        changes in the interpretation of audio stimuli.</li>
                    <li>Subject's mental capacity and reaction time were not significantly impacted by <span
                        style="color: #5fa052;">SCP-714</span>
                        during the test.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>When the ring was removed and the audio was replayed, no difference in perception was noted.</p>
                    <p>I can therefore conclude that while <span
                        style="color: #5fa052;">SCP-714</span> may have other effects on subjects wearing it, it does not in any notable way affect nor impair the subject's perception of auditory stimuli.</p>
